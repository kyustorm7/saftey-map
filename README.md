# Saftey Map App Project
By using a variety of public data on the locations of safety facilities and equipments such as CCTVs, Security Lights and police facilities, the saftey map will show how safe the area is by showing which and how many of those facilities are near you.

## Project Analysis
In 2019, the Statistics Department of Korea University launched a big-data analysis presentation fair, which like a science fair, groups of students have data-analysis projects and present their work in front of the students and faculty. 

My team, composed of 3 people, submitted a data visualization project using R, plotting the locations and proximity of the public safety.

## Data description
The Raw_Data file shows the serial numbers and the coordinates of the security lights in South Korea including Seoul. 

The Processed_Data file shows the coordinates of the saftey facilities in Seoungbuk-Gu, Seoul.

## Main Packages
The team mainly used ggmap and ggplot2 to plot the map and shiny to use the program on the web.
